MVP:
    + Auth0 authentication
    + Save user information into mongoDB
    + Upload artwork
    + Vote on artwork
    + Artist Profile Page

2.0:
    + Show timeline of a single artwork as the artist creates it.
    + Comment on artwork

mongoDB:
    + When a user signs in with auth0, save the profile information to mongoDB or mySQL
    + Figure out how to save images in the cloud.
    + I think the best route here is to upload them to a bucket, and then distribute links to the image in the bucket.
    + Images:
        - art_id: string
        - artist_id: string
        - artist_name: string
        - votes: number = 0 (voters.length)
        - voters: userId[]
        - url: string
        - date_uploaded: datetime
        - dimensions: number x number
        - medium: string (oil, watercolor, etc.)
        - comments: string[]

    + Users:
        - user_id: string
        - user_email: string
        - user_password?
        - user_firstName: string
        - user_lastName: string
        - date_joined: datetime
        - images: image[]

modularization:
    + initialize array to hold images

Milestones:
    + get 1 artist to upload artwork
    + get 10 artists to upload artwork
    + get 1 user to vote on artwork
    + get 10 users to vote on artwork
