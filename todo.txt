MVP:
    + Auth0 authentication
    + Save user information into mongoDB
    + Upload artwork
    + Vote on artwork
    + Artist Profile Page


2.0:
    + Show timeline of a single artwork as the artist creates it.
    + Comment on artwork


mongoDB:
    + When a user signs in with auth0, save the profile information to mongoDB or mySQL
    + Figure out how to save images in the cloud.
    + I think the best route here is to upload them to a bucket, and then distribute links to the bucket.
    + Images:
        - artist_id
        - artist_name
        -

modularization:
    + initialize array to hold images 


Milestones:
    + get 1 artist to upload artwork
    + get 10 artists to upload artwork
    + get 1 user to vote on artwork
    + get 10 users to vote on artwork
